# dotaLED

A small program for submitting _Dota 2_ game data via SerialPort into an Arduino board, which controls led strips.

This program uses [Dota2GSI](https://github.com/antonpup/Dota2GSI)

**NOTE** Since Dota 2 doesn't have any official GSI documentation, VAC getting triggered might be a cause for concern. Use at your own risk
